This project is far from complete. Shit will break. Promise!

But, if you want to try:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install Vagrant. https://www.vagrantup.com/
3. run install.sh
4. Wait.
5. Wait some more.
6. Really, wait more.
7. You're thinking about complaining how slowly this is going? You should wait some more.
8. Better be safe than sorry, wait some more.
9. With some amount of luck you'll have a working VM without search indexes at this point.

The search indexes are next. If you encounter an error, ping ruaok in #metabrainz on Freenode.
